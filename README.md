A passionate .NET developer with a focus on backend technologies. I specialize in building scalable, maintainable applications using C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and MSSQL. While my core expertise lies in backend development, I also have experience working with frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔧 Technologies & Tools:

Backend: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, MSSQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery
Containerization: Docker
Cloud Services: AWS 
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Architecture: Clean Architecture, Repository & Unit of Work Patterns


🚀 What I Do: I focus on building robust and scalable backend systems, and I love working on projects that require designing efficient solutions. I’m also open to improving my frontend skills as needed and contribute to full-stack development when necessary.

🌱 Currently Learning: I’m currently expanding my knowledge of cloud services (AWS), Docker, and working on improving my frontend development skills.
